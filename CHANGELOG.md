# Changelog

All notable changes to Templado are documented in this file using the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## [4.2.5] - 2024-02-14

### Changed

* Configured directories and files that should not be added to archives

## [4.2.4] - 2023-07-07

This release is the last scheduled feature release in the 4.x branch. New features will
be implemented in Templado 5.x only. Updates to 4.x are going to be made to ensure compatibility
with upcoming PHP versions as long as possible. For Bugfixes, please just open a ticket.

### Changed
* Replaced generic ClearNamespaceDefinitionsFilter
  Replaced with a specifc one that only removes hopefully redundant xmlns defintions for xhtml.

  This still has many potential issues but is a lot better than the previous approach.

## [4.2.3] - 2023-05-16

### Fixed
* CSRFProtectionRendererTest fails with PHP 8.3.0-dev due to invalid xmlns


## [4.2.2] - 2022-11-08

### Changed
* ClearNamespaceDefinitionsFilter now supports an optional root node name that will get the xhtml xmlns set

### Fixed
* `Html::asString()` no longer has unexpected side effects on the working DOM (which may have lead to namespaces being unset)

## [4.2.1] - 2022-08-24

### Fixed
* [#26](https://github.com/templado/engine/issues/26): `EmptyElementsFilter` can cause invalid markup


## [4.2.0] - 2022-04-28

### Changed

* Include information from libxml_get_last_error() in TempladoException message (Thanks @sebastianbergmann)

### Added

* `Html::extractAsSnippets` to allow extraction of elements as snippets 


## [4.1.4] - 2022-01-25

### Fixed

* `SnapshotAttributeList`: PHP 8.1 deprecation notices


## [4.1.3] - 2021-09-07

### Added

* Added option to `SnippetLoader` to explictly specify snippet id to use when loading


## [4.1.2] - 2021-08-25

### Fixed

* Regression from 4.1.1: `SnippetRenderer` was missing a type check


## [4.1.1] - 2021-08-25

### Fixed

* Regression from 4.0.5 in `SnippetRenderer`: A multi element `TempladoSnippet` only handled
  the first element when applied in replace mode, ignoring the sibling elements

* `TempladoSnippet` returned the replaced context node anchored in the wrong document


## [4.1.0] - 2021-08-10

### Fixed

* The FormDataRenderer now also finds a `<form>` element when it's the document root element

### Added

* Introduced fluent interface for easier chaining to `Html::applySnippet()`, `Html::applySnippets()`, `Html::applyViewModel()`,
  `Html::applyFormData()`, `Html::applyCSRFProtection()`, and `Html::applyTransformation()`

* Added `Html::toSnippet` to allow for easier re-use and nesting

* Added new convenience method `Html::applySnippet` to reduce boilerplate code when only adding a single snippet

## [4.0.6] - 2021-03-20

### Fixed

* Consecutive nodes with the same property got incorrectly always treated as if in array processing mode and thus the
  presumed redundant ones got removed.

  
## [4.0.5] - 2021-01-09

### Fixed

* An invalid duplicate ID exception could be triggered in `SnippetRenderer` because of an invalid use of DOMNodelist, reported privately by @spriebsch

## [4.0.4] - 2020-10-25

### Fixed

* Regression: A Null type check in `ViewModelRenderer` was not working correctly, producing false positives

## [4.0.3] - 2020-10-08

### Fixed

* CSRFProtectionRenderer could have leaked an internal DOMXPath reference over multiple invocations

### Changed

* The `ViewModelRenderer` now produces a more helpful error messages when it encounters unsupported types

## [4.0.2] - 2019-11-21

### Fixed

* [#17](https://github.com/templado/engine/issues/17): CSRFPotectionRenderer fails to update existing token element when in xml namespace

## [4.0.1] - 2019-09-20

### Changed

* The `Iterator` returned by the `Selection` class is no longer based on `DOMNodeList` but on `ArrayIterator`. This is
  necessary to not have the list reset on changes to the DOM but to provide a stable Snapshots of the selection result.   
  
## [4.0.0] - 2019-09-13

### Changed

* The `ViewModelRenderer` now ensures that text content can no longer be used to create syntactically invalid markup.
  While this is technically a bug fix, some  may consider it a BC break as it also removes the "non-feature" of
  having a model returning xml/html markup. If you need html fragments to be inserted, please use a snippet instead.
* `SnapshotDOMNodelist` no longer implements \Iterator and \Countable as those became superflous

### Fixed

* ViewModelRenderer: Might skip a node when processing arrays due to invalid use of foreach on iteration

## [3.0.1] - 2019-05-26

### Changed 

* The `SnippetFileLoader` now returns `TempladoSnippts` for templado type snippets rather than `SimpleSnippets`, 
which never workd reliably due to DOMDocumentFragment issues.

### Fixed

* Fix iterable detection in ViewModelRenderer
* Fix potential index underflow in SnapshotDomNodelist

## [3.0.0] - 2019-05-16

### Changed

* Raise minimum PHP Version to 7.2
* Explicitly clear libxml error buffer (PHP internal global state for the win, Thanks @spriebsch)

### Fixed

* Detect and prohibit potential endless recursion in SnippetRenderer (Thanks @spriebsch)
  

## [2.3.2] - 2018-10-26

* [#9](https://github.com/templado/engine/issues/9): Removing an Attribute breaks Iteration in View ModelRenderer

## [2.2.6] - 2018-02-06

### Fixed

* [#8](https://github.com/templado/engine/issues/8): Error: Call to a member function removeChild() on null in ViewModelRenderer

## [2.2.0] - 2017-11-24
